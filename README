About
-----

JHelioviewer is a visualization tool for solar physics data based on the JPEG
2000 image compression standard. JPEG 2000 offers many useful new features and
has the potential to revolutionize the way high- resolution image data are
disseminated and analyzed. Using JPEG 2000, we can serve data to a client in
highly compressed, quality progressive, and region-of-interest based form. These
features make it possible to minimize the data transmitted while maximizing the
use of the data that is transmitted. This is especially relevant for solar
physics since NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is
providing more than a terabyte of image data per day. Providing efficient access
to such large data volumes at both high spatial and high time resolution is of
paramount importance to support scientific discovery.

JHelioviewer is based on two separate projects:

- The JPEG2000 encoding/decoding algorithms are provided by the Kakadu SDK:

- The Java application has its origins in the J2KViewer project:

Report a Problem or Idea
------------------------

If you have a problem or have ideas for improvements please report them on:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/jhelioviewer/+filebug

We will try to solve your problem as fast as possible. The more details you can
provide the easier it is for us. For example your system specifications
(hardware and software with version numbers) as well as a detailed description
what you did (so we can reproduce the problem are very helpful. If possible,
please also be ready to provide the log files from the session where the problem
occured. The log files can be found in the Logs/ directory of your JHelioviewer
home folder. You can find the correct log file by searching for the correct
start date. The files have the form:
jhv.'year'-'month'-'day'T'hours'-'minutes'-'seconds'.log
